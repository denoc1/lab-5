Making change

Use the following template(or something similar) to write a program that gives exact change with the least number of coins for a given number of cents. Use intermediate variables to help your calculation. 


              public static void main(String[] args){
                 int totalCents = 137;  //137 can be any number
                 // your code here.

               }

              
            //  Output should be: 5 quarters, 1 dimes, 0 nickels, 2 pennies. 

This code should work for ANY value that totalCents is initialized to be.  Be sure to test several options.

Be sure to include:
-	Create a comment header as before, with your name, description, date, and any people who assisted you
-	Necessary variables of the appropriate type along the way to solve the problem
-	Output is in a readable format
-	Output is based on the original value of the totalCents.  If totalCents is changed, the output should change appropriately.
-	Be sure to test your code on a variety of initial values to be sure your code is working properly for different cases.
    What cases should you try?
-	Submit your assignment by making a COMMIT with a COMMIT comment, then SYNC CHANGES
